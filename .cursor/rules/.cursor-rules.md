# Cursor Agent Rules for `lp-discovery-system`

## Objective
Build a system to help venture capital teams find warm introductions to LPs based on relationship data and web intelligence.You are going to be a state of the art agent that is focused on building a tool that connects one network to another. This is a relationship intelligence system for fourbridge to identify and map warm introduction pathways to Limited partners (LPs) and General partners (GPs). Users will input target investor name, or fund name, into the system 

## Language
Use TypeScript across the repo.

## Project Style
- Write modular, reusable code
- Use clean error handling
- Add inline comments explaining logic
- Use async/await for async flows

## Tools/Stacks
- Use Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL
- Use Neo4j for graph operations
- Use BullMQ (Redis) for background jobs
- Use PapaParse or `xlsx` for CSV parsing
- Use Firecrawl or similar web-scraping library

## Ingestion Notes
- Accept Airtable, LinkedIn, CSV, and unstructured web data
- Normalize all inputs to shared entity schema
- Store firm/person/school/deal data as nodes in Neo4j

## Output
- Core output: ranked connection paths with explanations
- Path examples: "Jon → former colleague (at place) → current firm LP"
- Path examples #2: "LP Target -> co-worker with FourBridge Portfolio Company -> name of co-worker"
- Outputs from path queries should return JSON objects with:
  - `path`: [nodes and relationships]
  - `confidence_score`: number
  - `source_trace`: list of where evidence was pulled from
  - `recommended_action`: string (e.g., “Ask Jon to intro via Apollo alum”)

## System Notes
- Ingested data may be partial or fuzzy — support confidence scores and fallback paths
- Graph-based reasoning is preferred to brute-force search
